# Exercise 1: Sorting whole numbers

## Exercise 1a: Sorting `vector`

#### Issue #1
Ran into an issue where, even though I'm seemingly generating a new random vector every time with `rand()`, the numbers are the same each run. When debugging, it seems like `rand()` is genuinely just predictably spitting out the same numbers in the same order.

> [!NOTE]
> This is because `rand()` is not random in C++ ğŸ™‚

#### Issue #2
```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = GetRandomNumbers();
numbers = GetRandomNumbers(); // this crashes the program ğŸ˜³
```

#### Issue #3

`std::random_shuffle` apparently does not exist despite `#include <algorithm>` ğŸ¤·

### Solution

To create the randomized vector:
```cpp
int size = 12;
std::vector<int> numbers;

for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
{
    numbers.push_back(rand());
}
```

The problem here is that the numbers are random in a sense, but they will be the same every time the program runs because `rand()` isn't really random. But it works for our purposes, so let's move on.

#### main.cpp
```cpp
std::vector<int> randomNumbers = GetRandomNumbers();
cout << "Random ";
PrintNumbers(randomNumbers);

std::sort(randomNumbers.begin(), randomNumbers.end());
cout << "Sorted ";
PrintNumbers(randomNumbers);
```
Output
```
Random Numbers: 41 18467 6334 26500 19169 15724 11478 29358 26962 24464 5705 28145
Sorted Numbers: 41 5705 6334 11478 15724 18467 19169 24464 26500 26962 28145 29358
```
